 In a groundbreaking discovery, marine biologists have announced the identification of a previously unknown species of bioluminescent organisms deep within the Pacific Ocean. This finding sheds new light on the biodiversity of Earth's oceans and raises intriguing questions about the role of these creatures in the marine ecosystem.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Alexandra Rodriguez, embarked on an expedition to study the mysterious depths of the Pacific's Mariana Trench. Equipped with state-of-the-art submersibles and advanced imaging technology, the team ventured into uncharted territory in search of unique marine life.\n\nDuring their expedition, the team stumbled upon a mesmerizing display of bioluminescence in the inky darkness of the trench. These creatures, tentatively named \"Luminarum maris,\" emit a soft, ethereal glow that is believed to be part of their mating and communication behaviors.\n\nDr. Rodriguez commented, \"The discovery of Luminarum maris is a testament to the vastness of the ocean's depths and the potential for finding new life forms that have remained hidden for millions of years. The bioluminescence of these organisms is truly a sight to behold.\"\n\nFurther studies are underway to understand the physiology, behavior, and ecological role of Luminarum maris in its deep-sea habitat. Researchers are also examining the potential applications of the bioluminescent compounds produced by these creatures, which could have implications for medical imaging and environmental monitoring.\n\nThe discovery underscores the importance of ongoing ocean exploration and conservation efforts. As human activities continue to impact marine environments, understanding the delicate balance of life beneath the waves becomes increasingly crucial.\n\nAs scientists eagerly delve into the secrets of Luminarum maris, the world awaits with bated breath, anticipating what other remarkable discoveries the depths of our oceans might hold. \"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-14T14:22:53.125722Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-14T14:22:53.126136Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-14T14:22:53.133169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-14T14:22:53.126106Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-14T14:22:53.132065Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below is a api of Eden AI","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# here i am using Eden AI for text summarisation\n\n# import json\n# import requests\n\n# headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYWYwMjZmZmYtYTVmZS00YTBlLWJiZTctZmRlOTRmMzg4M2MwIiwidHlwZSI6ImFwaV90b2tlbiJ9.1DWqMba4gmFSN0yFH0w0VHWn7kLaHcjf82RKnn8R2RU\"}\n\n# url =\"https://api.edenai.run/v2/text/summarize\"\n# payload={\"providers\": \"microsoft,connexun\", \"language\": \"en\", \"text\": text}\n\n# response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)\n\n# result = json.loads(response.text)\n# print(result['microsoft']['result'])\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-14T14:22:54.835191Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-14T14:22:54.835812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-14T14:23:02.719429Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-14T14:22:54.835781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-14T14:23:02.718431Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The research team, led by Dr. Alexandra Rodriguez, embarked on an expedition to study the mysterious depths of the Pacific's Mariana Trench.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
